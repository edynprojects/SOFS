                Before Dear Royalty, my daughter always compared herself to
                other girls on social media. She would avoid mirrors and say
                she’s ‘not enough.’ Three weeks into the program, she started
                speaking differently — ‘Mummy, I’m valuable.’ I cried the day
                she wrote herself an affirmation letter. Thank you for giving me
                back my confident princess.

                I used to shout a lot because I felt that was the only way to be
                heard. SmartPath helped me truly understand my son’s wiring.
                Now, instead of reacting in anger, I respond with wisdom. Our
                home is more peaceful. Even my husband said, ‘Whatever you’re
                learning, keep going.’

                gave me clarity.
